## Test

This example can be tested with following apps:

* ING Mesh (WeChat mini program) - recommended
* ING Mesh (iOS App) - recommended
* nRF Mesh (iOS/Android)

## Others

* By default, this example stores the following information in flash:
  * __Device name__
  * __MAC address__ (gatt_adv_addr and non-connect_adv_addr)
  * __Adv UUID__
  * __Provisioning Information__
* Press __KEY-2__ and then press __KEY-RESET__ to clear all flash information. 

* If you don't want to store any information in flash, you can disable the corresponding flash storage function by masking the following macro definitions: 
  * __MESH_UUID_USE_FLASH__ : For Adv UUID
  * __MESH_NAME_USE_FLASH__ : For Device name
  * __MESH_GATT_ADV_ADDR_USE_FLASH__ : For gatt_adv_addr
  * __MESH_BEACON_ADV_ADDR_USE_FLASH__ : For non-connect_adv_addr
    * After you mask above macro definitions, the uuid, the name and the address will always use the default value. 
  * __MESH_STACK_TLV_USE_FLASH__ : For Provisioning Information
    * After you mask above macro definition, The provisioning information will not be stored in flash each time the provisioning is complete, so, if a chip reset occurs, the provisioning information will be lost.
